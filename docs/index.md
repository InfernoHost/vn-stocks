## Available Teams

| Symbol | Team Name | Starting Price | Volatility |
|--------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| **STMP** | Steamporium | 20 Cogs | Medium |
| **ROSE** | Rosebud | 15 Cogs | Low |
| **VIOL** | Violetvale | 18 Cogs | High |
| **POT** | Potpourri | 12 Cogs | Medium |
| **CRAV** | Cravat | 25 Cogs | High |
| **VOC** | Voco | 16 Cogs | Low |

## How It Works

### 1. Activity Drives Prices 📊
When team members chat in Discord, their team's stock becomes more valuable. More messages = higher demand = price goes up!

### 2. Market Updates Every 3 Minutes ⏱️
The bot runs a market simulator that updates all prices based on:
- **Random volatility** (market noise)
- **Activity scores** (message counts)
- **Momentum** (trend persistence)
- **Mean reversion** (natural price corrections)

### 3. You Make Profit 💰
Buy low, sell high! Watch the charts, follow team activity, set up alerts, and time your trades perfectly.

## Currency System

GSC uses a dual currency system for maximum precision:

- **1 Cog = 64 Spurs**
- You start with **10 Cogs** (640 Spurs)
- All prices shown in Cogs (e.g., "15.75 Cogs")
- Internal calculations use Spurs for accuracy

Think of Cogs like dollars and Spurs like cents, but with a 64:1 ratio instead of 100:1.
