# Frequently Asked Questions ❓

Common questions and answers about GSC Stock Exchange.

## Getting Started

### How do I start trading?

Type `/register` in Discord to create your account. You'll receive 10 Cogs starting capital automatically.

### Can I register more than once?

No, each Discord account can only register once. Your account and balance are permanent.

### What if I lose all my money?

Contact an admin - they might give you a small bailout to get back on your feet! Or wait for giveaways and events.

## Money & Pricing

### What are Cogs and Spurs?

**Cogs** are the main currency (like dollars). **Spurs** are fractional units (like cents).
- 1 Cog = 64 Spurs
- All prices shown in Cogs
- Bot handles conversion automatically

### Why 64 Spurs per Cog?

It's based on Minecraft's stack system (64 items per stack) and fits the server's lore!

### How are prices calculated?

Every 3 minutes, prices update based on:
- **Team activity** (40%) - Discord messages from team members
- **Random volatility** (30%) - Natural market noise
- **Momentum** (20%) - Trend persistence
- **Mean reversion** (10%) - Price corrections

### Can prices go negative?

No, prices have a minimum floor to prevent going below zero.

### Why did a stock price suddenly spike/crash?

Could be:
- High team activity in Discord
- Random volatility (especially for VIOL/CRAV)
- Momentum from existing trend
- Multiple traders buying/selling

## Trading

### How do I know when to buy or sell?

**Buy signals:**
- Price dropped significantly (10%+)
- Team activity is ramping up
- Candlestick chart shows reversal pattern

**Sell signals:**
- You've made good profit (20%+)
- Price spiked unusually high
- Team activity is dying down

See the [Trading Guide](/trading) for detailed strategies!

### What's the best stock to buy?

There's no "best" stock - each has pros and cons:
- **High volatility** (VIOL/CRAV) - Bigger gains but riskier
- **Low volatility** (ROSE/VOC) - Safer but smaller gains
- **Active teams** - More price movement

Diversify across multiple stocks!

### Can I lose more money than I have?

No, you can only buy what you can afford. The bot prevents overdrafts.

### Why can't I sell my stocks?

Check:
- Do you actually own those shares? (Use `/portfolio`)
- Are you typing the symbol correctly?
- Did you already place a sell limit order for them?

### Do I pay fees or commissions?

No! All trades are commission-free. Buy/sell at market price with no extra costs.

## Limit Orders

### What happens if my limit order never triggers?

Orders expire after **24 hours** automatically. You can create a new one if still interested.

### Can I edit a limit order?

No, you must cancel it (`/cancelorder`) and create a new one.

### Why did my limit order cancel automatically?

Possible reasons:
- Order expired (24 hour limit)
- You sold the shares manually (for sell orders)
- Admin reset the market
- Insufficient balance at execution time

### Do limit orders cost anything to create?

**Buy orders:** Money is reserved when created  
**Sell orders:** Shares must be in portfolio  
No fees for creating/canceling orders!

## Price Alerts

### How often are alerts checked?

Every **60 seconds**, the bot scans all prices and triggers matching alerts.

### Why didn't I get an alert?

Check:
- Are DMs enabled for this server?
- Did you set the alert direction correctly (above/below)?
- Did the price actually cross your threshold?
- Alert triggers once then deletes - already triggered?

### Can I reuse an alert?

No, alerts are one-time use. After triggering, they auto-delete. Create a new one if needed.

### How many alerts can I have?

Unlimited! Set as many as you want.

## Charts & Analysis

### What do the graph colors mean?

**TradingView style:**
- **Green line** - Price is above starting point
- **Red line** - Price is below starting point
- **Dark background** - Easier on the eyes
- **Grid lines** - Help read exact values

### What are candlestick charts?

Each "candle" shows price movement over one hour:
- **Green candle** - Price went up
- **Red candle** - Price went down
- **Wick** - Shows highest/lowest prices
- **Body** - Shows open/close prices

See [Advanced Features](/advanced#candlestick-charts) for details!

### Why does the graph show "no data"?

Stock might be brand new with limited price history. Wait a few hours for data to accumulate.

### Can I see historical data from weeks ago?

Yes! Use `/candlestick symbol:STMP period:30d` for last 30 days of data.

## Portfolio & Performance

### How is profit/loss calculated?

**For each stock:**
```
P/L = (Current Price × Shares) - (Average Buy Price × Shares)
```

**Total P/L:**
```
Total = (Cash + Portfolio Value) - Starting Capital (10 Cogs)
```

### What does ROI mean?

**Return on Investment** - percentage gain or loss:
```
ROI = (Profit / Investment) × 100%
```

Example: Invested 100 Cogs, now worth 125 Cogs = +25% ROI

### Why is my portfolio value different from my purchases?

Prices change! Your portfolio value is based on **current market prices**, not what you paid.

## Achievements

### How do I earn achievements?

Achievements unlock automatically when you meet the criteria. No need to claim them!

### Can I lose achievements?

No, once earned they're permanent badges!

### What's the rarest achievement?

**🌟 Moon Mission** (Legendary) - Requires 1000%+ profit on a single trade. Extremely difficult!

## Technical Issues

### Bot isn't responding to commands

Check:
- Is the bot online? (Should show green status)
- Are you in the right Discord server?
- Did you spell the command correctly? (Use `/` to see autocomplete)

### "This interaction failed" error

Usually means:
- Bot lagged (try again)
- Invalid parameters (check symbol names, numbers)
- Database timeout (rare, try again)

### Graphs not displaying

Make sure:
- Discord can display embeds/images
- Your internet connection is stable
- Graph command has all required parameters

## Strategy Questions

### What's the best strategy for beginners?

**Activity trading:**
1. Watch Discord channels
2. Buy stocks when teams are super active
3. Sell after a few updates when activity dies
4. Repeat!

Simple and effective. See [Trading Guide](/trading) for more!

### Should I buy and hold or day trade?

**Buy and hold (long-term):**
- Less stressful
- Safer, steadier gains
- Good for busy people

**Day trading (short-term):**
- More active, more exciting
- Can make quick profits
- Requires constant monitoring

Try both and see what fits your style!

### How much should I invest in each stock?

**Safe approach:**
- 20-25% per stock
- Hold 4-5 different stocks
- Keep 15-20% cash

**Aggressive approach:**
- 30-40% per stock
- Hold 2-3 stocks
- Keep 10% cash

Never put 100% in one stock!

## Market Mechanics

### Why do some teams have higher volatility?

It's part of their configuration - reflects team characteristics:
- **High volatility** - More chaotic, unpredictable teams
- **Low volatility** - Stable, consistent teams

Volatility can't be changed.

### Does selling affect the price?

No, individual trades don't move the market. Prices only change during 3-minute update cycles based on activity and algorithms.

### Can admins manipulate prices?

Yes, admins can use `/setprice` for manual adjustments, but it's logged. Used mainly for bug fixes or special events.
